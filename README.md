# Disease-Prediction
Emergencies and disasters impact population health. Public health plays a critical role in working with health and non-health sectors responsible for preparing for and responding to emergencies. In emergencies, large numbers of people may require medical attention. Health care systems may be over-stretched, and public order may be threatened. Hence, try to develop an e-healthcare system to support patients and predict if the disease can be cured at home.
In this project we are using Python language to build GUI:
- For GUI we are using tkinter library.
- For symptoms analytics we use pandas library.
- We use disease_prediction.csv as dataset extracting from kaggle.com { This dataset is used during analysis }

In this project, we are going to build a  simple application by which user can set symtoms of disease and click on predict button. After that we have got disease which have common symptoms and user have to select that disease and we get ou required result that is precautions and cures of that disease.

Thank you for giving us such an interesting and challengable project.
